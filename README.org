* EZID

This is a simple bash script that is designed to simplify the maintainance of
ezids.  It's a bash script, but it combines with another set of bash tools.
This includes [[https://httpie.org/][HTTPIE]] and [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][JQ]].  So, you will need to install these packages if you
want to use this script.

A good review of the organization of the ark: can be found in the [[https://ezid.cdlib.org/learn/id_concepts][ID Concepts]]
description.
